# Classification-and-Regression
### Comp 341 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - ML Project

This project is about machine learning. We are given one dataset for binary classification and three datasets for regression.
The binary classificiation includes images and requires the usage of OpenCV.
We implemented k-Nearest Neighbors and linear regression. We compared these to logistic regression and ridge regression, respectively.

The detailed project description can be found in the description PDF.
